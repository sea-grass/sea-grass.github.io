This repository contains the content for the website and the source code for its static site builder.

The current incarnation uses svelte-kit as the builder, but since I've gone through so many site generators, I'm trying to keep the site content entirely separate from the site generator to make it as portable as possible.

- [Site content](./site/)
- [Site builder](./scripts/builder/)
