- This guide on sharing pixel data between JS and Zig over `WebAssembly.Memory` helped me to get started: [https://github.com/daneelsan/minimal-zig-wasm-canvas]
- The readme from this project gave me a good idea of the surface area I'd need when it came to JS-Zig cross-communication: https://github.com/Jack-Ji/jok
- This ziggit forum post helped me get past an error I was seeing with respect to building the wasm blob: https://ziggit.dev/t/building-a-wasm-shared-library-that-does-not-import-memory-from-the-environment/2240
- This repo is a good source of Zig demos that target wasm, and I always find myself revisiting their readme when I find myself scratching my head: https://github.com/sleibrock/zigtoys/blob/main/README.md
