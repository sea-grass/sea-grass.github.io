# What is quantum programming, really?

## (Programming) Languages

This blog post is geared towards those familiar with programming, but I'll try to keep explanations as general as possible. I'm still very much a beginner in quantum programming, myself, so bear with me.

> Note: I'll use the term programming language more often than e.g. spoken language, so I'll abbreviate programming language to language.

If you were to learn a new (programming) language, you might take stock of what you know about other languages: their syntax, memory model, language features, standard libraries, paradigm, etc. You'd consider these as you assess the new language.

Let's say you know Python and you're trying to learn some language, X. You might be able to start with a series of simple questions to quickly come to grasps with it.

You might follow this process for general purpose languages, but what about languages that are geared towards a very specific purpose? Such a language is called a DSL, or Domain Specific Language.

There's a blurry line between general purpose languages and DSLs. Would a quantum language be considered a DSL, since it's in the quantum domain? What about the quantum language, `Q#`, which is a general purpose language?

## Learning a quantum language

In order to learn a quantum language, you need a quantum problem.

### The promise of quantum

Modern computing is binary. That is, data and instructions are made up of bits that are either one or zero. In quantum computing, the atomic unit is called a qubit and is made of two bits.

In modern computing, data and instructions are represented as bits. In quantum computing, is the same true with qubits rather than bits, or is it only the data that is represented as qubits?
