# Migrating from Elderjs to Svelte-Kit



Svelte-Kit was pre-1.0 while I built the Truth in Journalism website.
I went with Elder.js because of its promise to help you build modular, scalable websites using static site generation, with incremental regeneration.

These days, with what I've learned through implementing an Elder.js site and where Svelte-Kit is now, I'm considering how I might be able to migrate the site
from one technology to another.

  - Make the Elder.js changes myself
  - Leave it as it is
